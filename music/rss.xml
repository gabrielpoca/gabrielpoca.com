            <![CDATA[<p>I’m struggling to combine my different ideas in a song. Most work in isolation, but when I try to put two together it doesn’t work. Making transitions on the 707 is also not a great experience, but I’m trying to not use anything outside of it to make sure I learn the machine to its limits. In this song, I even got to change the sound of the main piano.</p><div class="mt-4" style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;">  <iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KohaXaWs1gs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>I’m proud of this instrumental. I’m not sure if someone would sing on it, but I enjoy listening to it. I did everything on the MC707, and there was no editing, mixing, or anything on a computer, which is precisely how I want to approach this hobby.</p><p>I started by creating a few progressions and melodies with the sounds you can hear in the instrumental. I then resampled those pieces without the drums and the bass and made a few more progressions and melodies. I repeated the cycle, and in the end, I had 4 sections that I felt went well together. Besides the internal sounds from MC707, I recorded an ambulance a couple of months ago.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>I built most of the sections on the MC707 and recorded them into Reaper to arrange and mix. I wanted to move everything into Reaper because I struggle with transitions between sections, and working on it on the computer feels easier. I’m not sure whether these sections don’t work well together, or I don’t know how to make them work together. You can also see that my drums still suck. My next one is almost finished, and I’m pretty confident that I improved in both of these areas.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>I was really digging the piano loop from the previous entry, so I decided to put a little more work into it. This is what I came up with. The “song” has two parts, all instruments are VSTs that I played in the launchpad, the voices are recordings that I did in the past except one that’s from Youtube. I didn’t put a lot of effort into the drums because I got tired of it before I had time to get there.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>I was playing around with the piano and trying to build a nice, and complicated, chord progression. The result is the piano you hear. Loved it. Threw a couple of synths on top of it. Even better! It gets a bit crazy by th end. It was a good session.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>In this loop I’m mostly experimenting with kicks and bass. There are two bassses, one only enter after the “drop”, the idea was to make it sound like a growl. The whole porpose of this experiment was to try and make a drop.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>Two little loops I’ve been playing around with. Both have a sample + some VST instruments on top. I feel that using a couple of samples make the song feel more organic and rough, I can never get that feeling when I only use VST instruments. I guess I have to level up my editing skills.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>I put a lot of effort into this track, but I can’t make myself finish it. I think it’s a better investment of my time to make more tracks than making this one “perfect”. There’s a main sample, some VSTs and drum sounds I collected from the web. The voice samples are from a TV Show my girlfriend happen to be watching at the time.</p>]]>
