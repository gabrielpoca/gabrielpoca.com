  h1 Hi! <br /> I'm Gabriel PoÃ§a!

  p.P
     | I'm a software developer working in the Fintech and Medtech industries. I'm
       into all kinds of things, such as books, making music or customizing my
       editor.

  h2 Now

  p.P
    | I always have a couple of projects ongoing (Notedown, learning music
      production) but right now I'm focusing most of my time in a static site
      generator for the Elixir community.

  h2 Blog

  ul.BlogList
    = Enum.map sort_posts(get_collections("post")), fn post ->
      li.BlogListItem
        = link post[:variables][:title], to: post[:output_file]
        .BlogListItem-date
          = post[:variables][:date]
