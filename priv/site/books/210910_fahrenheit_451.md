It's funny that a book written in 1953 feels like a social critique of today. It's an excellent and small book. I don't think I've learned anything with it, but it gave me some space and context to think about books, culture, freedom, education, and leisure. It helped me review some of my ideas on the subjects. It was a conversation between myself and me.
