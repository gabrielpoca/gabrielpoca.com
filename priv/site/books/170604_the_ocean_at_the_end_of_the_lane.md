I finished this book before I even knew what happened. The story is narrated by someone remembering his childhood memories. His memories are uncanny, but to the child they are just normal things that happen. Eventually he got himself hurt and, only then, he realises that his parents - his protectors - do not see what he sees and their worlds colide. Some of the events described by the child I could also find in my own memories, and I wonder if the whole story is about a boy that's bored, or hurt, and created this world to protect himself.
