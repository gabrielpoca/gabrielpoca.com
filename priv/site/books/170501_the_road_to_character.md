I have not had the time yet to observe what impact this book will have in my life, but I do believe that it will be big. This book answers (in a way) a lot of the hard questions in life by telling the stories of other people that lived many years ago. You'll find interesting that 1 thousand years ago people were dealing with the same problems we are, although you would already know that if you studied literature or philosophy. This book allowed me to make important observations about my life. It is allowing me to understand the different emotions that arise from the society we live in and giving me different tools to deal with them.
