I have mixed feelings about this book. The truth is that I hate the last half of it. Or used to hate. I thought that there would be a plot twist. I thought that everything would to make sense. All the details would mean something in the end. It didn't. There are some things that hint the book's message, but they are not very valuable. Now that I had some time to think about the characters, their struggles, their endings, I'm starting to like the book. I still think the ending is miserable, and most of the story doesn't really mean anything, but each different character is so well developed that every time you remember its' story you'll fall in love with it.
