It's been a while since I've read a book like this. I can't tell if it's the plot, the characters, the writing, or everything together, that made this book so enjoyable and captivating. This world feels so real. I'm not going to try to describe it that would be a disservice to the book. This will be the first book I will recommend in this genre from now on.
