This is a great book! The main story is full of twists, and I was always in a hurry to know what happened next. This is the kind of Sci-Fi I like: mixing imperfect people with technology. You follow multiple characters, and you can see their interpretation of the events and their inner struggle. This book explores the concept of being. What is it that makes you? If you could change something innate, would it still be you? What if you removed a memory that defines you? What if you lived forever? What does love mean in that context? There's so much good stuff in here, and I didn't even mention the technologies they explore throughout the book. Please go read it.
