I started reading this book because it was picked in Reddit's /r/books book club. I wasn't sure what to expect, and even though I'm a big manga lover, it's a complete experience. It's impressive, dark, morbid, and I loved it. I would not recommend it to most people, but for someone looking for a dystopia that challenges our rationale, this is it. I still think about this book and its underlying metaphor.
