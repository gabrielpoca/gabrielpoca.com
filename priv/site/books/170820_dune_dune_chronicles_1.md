When the story was about to get interesting, I thought, ok, I'm going to stop now and go to sleep. The next day I picked up the book, and there were only four pages left! The rest was the appendix. I'm eager to read the next book just to learn what happened! The story is very good, but the best thing in this book is the world and the people that inhabit it. The book is very immersive, and for some hours, I imagined what it would be like to live in a place like that.
