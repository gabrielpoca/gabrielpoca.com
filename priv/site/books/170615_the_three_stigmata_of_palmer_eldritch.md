This book talks about religion, identity and drugs. It features a world where everyone is comfortably numb; it challenges the idea of good do religion; and it challenges reality itself. By the end of the book, you're not sure what's happening. The book also talks about a new world, with different challenges and possibilities. It's a fascinating experience.
