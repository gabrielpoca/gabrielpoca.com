I don't think I can adequately convey the experience of reading this book. It took me a while, it's a big book, and there are some peculiarities about the writing that take some time to get used to. The book is full of lovely, hysteric characters like I've never seen. There are so many impressive, creative, and remarkable speeches in this book that sometimes, I feel like I see them in people I meet during my day. This book has so many stories that the "main" story is not that impressive compared to everything else. I have so many questions about this book. The moral dilemmas seem serious at first, funny after a while, but seeing how different characters think about the same event is impressive. I'm afraid to write a spoiler, even though the book has spoilers itself. Loved it.
