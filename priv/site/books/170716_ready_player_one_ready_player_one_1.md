This book is five stars. It got me hooked on the story. I kept turning pages. I was reading more than 3 hours in a row each time. Like most superhero movies these days, the book appeals to nostalgia, but I don't see anything wrong with that. It's a great book. <br/><br/>PS: don't check out the cast for the movie; there's a huge spoiler there.
