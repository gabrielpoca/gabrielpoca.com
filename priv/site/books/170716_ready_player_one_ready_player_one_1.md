This book is 5 stars. It got me hooked on the story. I kept turning pages. I was reading more than 3 hours in a row each time. The book appeals to nostalgia, like most of the superhero movies these days, but I don't see anything wrong with that, it's a great book. <br/><br/>PS: don't check out the cast for the movie, there's a huge spoiler there.
