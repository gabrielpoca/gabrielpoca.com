I'm proud of this instrumental.
I'm not sure if someone would sing on it, but I enjoy listening to it.
I did everything on the MC707, and there was no editing, mixing, or anything on a computer, which is precisely how I want to approach this hobby.

I started by creating a few progressions and melodies with the sounds you can hear in the instrumental.
I then resampled those pieces without the drums and the bass and made a few more progressions and melodies.
I repeated the cycle, and in the end, I had 4 sections that I felt went well together. Besides the internal sounds from MC707, I recorded an ambulance a couple of months ago.
