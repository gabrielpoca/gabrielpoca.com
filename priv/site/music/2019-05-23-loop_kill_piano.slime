p.P
  | Two little loops I've been playing around with. Both have a sample +
    some VST instruments on top. I feel that using a couple of samples make
    the song feel more organic and rough, I can never get that feeling when
    I only use VST instruments. I guess I have to level up my editing
    skills.
