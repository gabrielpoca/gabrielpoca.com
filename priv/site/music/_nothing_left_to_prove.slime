p.P
  | I put a lot of effort into this track, but I can't make myself finish
    it. I think it's a better investment of my time to make more tracks than
    making this one "perfect". There's a main sample, some VSTs and drum
    sounds I collected from the web. The voice samples are from a TV Show my
    girlfriend happen to be watching at the time.
