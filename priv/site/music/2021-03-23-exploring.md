I built most of the sections on the MC707 and recorded them into Reaper to
arrange and mix. I wanted to move everything into Reaper because
I struggle with transitions between sections, and working on it on the
computer feels easier. I'm not sure whether these sections don't work well
together, or I don't know how to make them work together. You can also see
that my drums still suck. My next one is almost finished, and I'm pretty
confident that I improved in both of these areas.
