For this one, I built most of all of the sections on the MC707 and then
recorded them into Reaper to arrange and mix. I wanted to move everything
into reaper because I struggle a lot with transitions between sections and
work on it on the computer feels easier. I'm not sure whether these
sections don't work well together or I don't know how to make them work
together. You can also see that my drums still suck. My next one is almost
finished and I'm pretty confident that I improved in both of these areas.
