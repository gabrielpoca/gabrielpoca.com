recorded directly. Here's the session:

<div class="mt-4" style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;">
  <iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_1Nv0Iz6zzk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
