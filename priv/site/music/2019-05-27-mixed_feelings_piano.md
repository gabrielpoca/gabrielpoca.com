I was really digging the piano loop from the previous entry, so I decided to
put a little more work into it. This is what I came up with. The "song" has two
parts, all instruments are VSTs that I played in the launchpad, the voices are
recordings that I did in the past except one that's from Youtube. I didn't put
a lot of effort into the drums because I got tired of it before I had time to
get there.
