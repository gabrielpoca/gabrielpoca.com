I think that I'm getting better making transitions between sections and
arranging my tracks. The MC707 is still my only instrument. I still don't know
which genre I want to make, but I know that I like having my sketches at the
end of my tracks as a surprise. I've started to upload these tracks to
<%= link @env, "Youtube", to: "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU6kRMDjfbSdP25r9xQBusA" %>.
I'm not that confident about the name of the channel, but I think that it works as a placeholder for now.
