  p.intro
    | Iâ€™m trying to get back into music production. I used to make and sell
      hip-hop beats. It's been a while, and I no longer have the same taste in
      music. I'm trying to understand what do I like right now, and I'm documenting
      my progress here, one audio clip at a time.
