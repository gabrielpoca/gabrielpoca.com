I put a lot of effort into this track, but I can't make myself finish it. I
think it's a better investment of my time to make more tracks than making this
one "perfect". There's a main sample, some VSTs and drum sounds I collected
from the web. The voice samples are from a TV Show my girlfriend happen to be
watching at the time.
