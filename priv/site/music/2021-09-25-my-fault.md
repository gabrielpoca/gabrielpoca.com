I'm struggling to combine my different ideas in a song. Most work in isolation, but when I try to put two together it doesn't work. Making transitions on the 707 is also not a great experience, but I'm trying to not use anything outside of it to make sure I learn the machine to its limits. In this song, I even got to change the sound of the main piano.
