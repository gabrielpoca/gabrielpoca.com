The world is exciting, and the story is captivating, but the author doesn't care about the characters. You spend so much time with Ye, but somehow I still feel like I don't know anything about that character's motivations. Did the killings change her? Did her daughter change her? Maybe her grandchildren? She's old, she tells the story, she learns the truth, and it's done. Wang, the main character, finds himself in a super weird and terrifying situation. Suddenly he's part of a cult, then he's part of mass murder, and then you don't even get to see him react to the truth, just the aftermath. The whole Adventists vs Redemptionists doesn't unfold into anything. It builds up a great story and then dumps the secrets on you and the end. Yeah, sometimes the characters don't matter to the story, but it doesn't feel like one of those situations, otherwise why spend so much time around them?","Number of Pages":"399","Original Publication Year":"2006","Original Purchase Date":"","Original Purchase Location":"","Owned Copies":"0","Private Notes":"","Publisher":"Tor Books","Read Count":"1","Recommended By":"","Recommended For":"","Spoiler":"true","Title":"The Three-Body Problem (Remembrance of Earth’s Past #1)","Year Published":"2014"},{"Additional Authors":"","Author":"Greg Egan","Author l-f":"Egan, Greg","Average Rating":"4.08","BCID":"","Binding":"Paperback","Book Id":"156784","Bookshelves":"","Bookshelves with positions":"","Condition":"","Condition Description":"","Date Added":"2019/09/20","Date Read":"2020-04-17","Exclusive Shelf":"read","Formatted Date Read":"2020-04-17","ISBN":"\"006105481X\"","ISBN13":"=\"9780061054815\"","My Rating":"5","My Review":"This is a great book!

Throughout the book, the author uses his experiences, the experiences of others, and research to support his arguments. At times, it does feel like the author is using only his experience to support an argument. Overall, a great book that I'm probably going to read again in a couple of years.","Number of Pages":"296","Original Publication Year":"2016","Original Purchase Date":"","Original Purchase Location":"","Owned Copies":"0","Private Notes":"","Publisher":"Grand Central Publishing","Read Count":"1","Recommended By":"","Recommended For":"","Spoiler":"","Title":"Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World","Year Published":"2016"},{"Additional Authors":"","Author":"Nick Bostrom","Author l-f":"Bostrom, Nick","Average Rating":"3.86","BCID":"","Binding":"Hardcover","Book Id":"20527133","Bookshelves":"","Bookshelves with positions":"","Condition":"","Condition Description":"","Date Added":"2017/09/04","Date Read":"2019-01-01","Exclusive Shelf":"read","Formatted Date Read":"2019-01-01","ISBN":"\"0199678111\"","ISBN13":"=\"9780199678112\"","My Rating":"3","My Review":"I didn't finish it.

Eventually he got himself hurt and, only then, he realises that his parents - his protectors - do not see what he sees and their worlds colide. Some of the events described by the child I could also find in my own memories, and I wonder if the whole story is about a boy that's bored, or hurt, and created this world to protect himself.","Number of Pages":"181","Original Publication Year":"2013","Original Purchase Date":"","Original Purchase Location":"","Owned Copies":"1","Private Notes":"","Publisher":"William Morrow Books","Read Count":"1","Recommended By":"","Recommended For":"","Spoiler":"true","Title":"The Ocean at the End of the Lane","Year Published":"2013"},{"Additional Authors":"Chris     Moore","Author":"Alfred Bester","Author l-f":"Bester, Alfred","Average Rating":"4.09","BCID":"","Binding":"Paperback","Book Id":"8493755","Bookshelves":"","Bookshelves with positions":"","Condition":"Like new","Condition Description":"","Date Added":"2017/05/30","Date Read":"2017-05-30","Exclusive Shelf":"read","Formatted Date Read":"2017-05-30","ISBN":"\"0575094192\"","ISBN13":"=\"9780575094192\"","My Rating":"5","My Review":"","Number of Pages":"244","Original Publication Year":"1956","Original Purchase Date":"","Original Purchase Location":"","Owned Copies":"1","Private Notes":"","Publisher":"Gollancz","Read Count":"1","Recommended By":"","Recommended For":"","Spoiler":"","Title":"The Stars My Destination","Year Published":"2010"},{"Additional Authors":"","Author":"Gene Wolfe","Author l-f":"Wolfe, Gene","Average Rating":"3.98","BCID":"","Binding":"Paperback","Book Id":"8493785","Bookshelves":"","Bookshelves with positions":"","Condition":"unspecified","Condition Description":"","Date Added":"2017/05/20","Date Read":"2017-05-20","Exclusive Shelf":"read","Formatted Date Read":"2017-05-20","ISBN":"\"0575094222\"","ISBN13":"=\"9780575094222\"","My Rating":"0","My Review":"","Number of Pages":"223","Original Publication Year":"1972","Original Purchase Date":"","Original Purchase Location":"","Owned Copies":"1","Private Notes":"","Publisher":"Gollancz","Read Count":"1","Recommended By":"","Recommended For":"","Spoiler":"","Title":"The Fifth Head of Cerberus","Year Published":"2010"},{"Additional Authors":"","Author":"David  Brooks","Author l-f":"Brooks, David","Average Rating":"3.66","BCID":"","Binding":"Hardcover","Book Id":"22551809","Bookshelves":"","Bookshelves with positions":"","Condition":"","Condition Description":"","Date Added":"2017/05/09","Date Read":"2017-05-01","Exclusive Shelf":"read","Formatted Date Read":"2017-05-01","ISBN":"\"081299325X\"","ISBN13":"=\"9780812993257\"","My Rating":"4","My Review":"I have not had the time yet to observe what impact this book will have in my life, but I do believe that it will be big.

You'll find interesting that 1 thousand years ago people were dealing with the same problems we are, although you would already know that if you studied literature or philosophy. This book allowed me to make important observations about my life. It is allowing me to understand the different emotions that arise from the society we live in and giving me different tools to deal with them.","Number of Pages":"320","Original Publication
