review: Iï»¿ honestly can't finish this series. It started with an interesting
  setup and a fantastic plot but became too weird and confusing. Sure, there
  were strange things all over the place from the beginning, but it got to a
  point where everything was just too convoluted, as if there weren't any rules
  in that world, and the only thing that matters is making the reader feel
  disturbed and sometimes disgusted.
