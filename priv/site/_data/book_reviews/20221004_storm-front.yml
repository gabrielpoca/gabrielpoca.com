review: I'm not about how this book got into my reading list. This is a book
  about a wizard detective. There's no spoiler because it's literally on the
  cover. I've read a few detective novels, but never with magic in the mix. It's
  a good book and easy to read. I'm not sure if it's targeted at younger
  audiences. Still, the way the author writes is accessible. I don't remember
  having to reach for the dictionary, which usually happens when I'm reading
  fantasy or science fiction. The plot is lightweight and a bit predictable, but
  the action is excellent!
