review: Wï»¿hen I realized this book was going to be told from multiple
  points-of-view I immediately had flashbacks of Game of Thrones and how I
  wouldn't say I liked following around some of the characters, but nothing like
  that. The characters are excellent. What fascinated me the most about the
  book, about the world it creates, is how different technologies that almost
  exist today come together to create weird and extraordinary ways of living.
  The plot is super good, but you should be able to guess where it's going, not
  that the ending is not surprising.
