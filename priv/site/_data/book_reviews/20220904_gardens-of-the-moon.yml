review: If I had to choose a single word to describe this book, I would go with
  "confusing". I feel bad giving it a bad review because I almost liked the
  book, but the writing is frustrating. I get that we are dropped into the
  middle of an ongoing story, and everyone knows what's happening, but we, the
  reader. But knowing that doesn't solve anything. There are many names of
  characters and organizations mentioned in passing, but you have no idea what
  they are and why they are important. Multiple times I re-read pages and jumped
  back a few pages to see if I missed something that would allow me to
  understand what was happening, but most times, there was nothing, and from
  checking online, it seems that most people had the same issue. I was hoping to
  find a new saga to read, but this is not it.
