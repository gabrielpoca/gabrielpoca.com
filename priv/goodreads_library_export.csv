Maybe her grandchildren? She's old, she tells the story, she learns the truth and it's done. Wang, the main character, finds himself in a super weird and terrifying situation, suddenly he's part of a cult, then he's part of a mass murder, and then you don't even get to see him react to the truth, just the aftermath. The whole Adventists vs Redemptionists doesn't unfold into anything really. It builds up a great story and then just dumps the secrets on you and the end.
